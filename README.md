# Welcome to my Hotel Engine Coding Challenge

## Startup
* clone the repo by clicking the green "code" dropdown in github, copying the https url, then going into your terminal and typing `git clone [paste url here]`
* then you need to go into the project with `cd [insert folder name here]`
* once you're in, hit that `yarn` and it should install all dependencies for the project
* that last step might take a moment, as soon as it finishes, you're ready to run the app
* in the same directory, go ahead and hit that `npm start`, that will start the dev server and open a tab in your browser
